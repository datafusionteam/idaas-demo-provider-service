# Pinnacle Chiropractic Provider Service

This is an example service which completes the DFS iDaaS POC demonstration. Pinnacle Chiropractic is a fictional chiropracter practice based in Georgia we use for the sake of the demonstration.

## What it Does

This service will automatically ingest all appointments attempting to be scheduled through Coeus and auto approve them. It does this through the power of iDaaS Connect and Kafka.

## Prerequisites

- Kafka
- HAPI FHIR Server
